[] -  npx tsconfig.json => automatically create the tsconfig file for your project
      (You can choose weither you want the settings for 'react, react-native, node')
      in this project i choose node

[] - yarn add -D ts-node =>  It allows you to run TypeScript in Node.js directly,
     without having to run the files through the TypeScript compiler (tsc).

[] - ts-node is relatively slow and does not run in the production env, that's why is better to use the watch command
